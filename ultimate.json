            "Tata Motors Limited: CRISIL Ratings has revised its rating outlook on the long-term bank facilities and non-convertible debentures of Tata Motors Limited (TML) to 'Positive' from 'Stable' and reaffirmed the rating at 'CRISIL AA'. The rating on the short-term bank facilities, short-term debt, and commercial paper has been reaffirmed at 'CRISIL A1+'. The revision in outlook is driven by the expectation of sustained improvement in Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) volume, revenue, and operating margin, which may result in an enhanced consolidated business and financial profile. Operating performance improved in the first half of fiscal 2024 due to strong volume growth in JLR, with a healthy order book providing visibility over the near to medium term. The improved revenue mix in terms of higher-margin products and operating leverage from increased volumes have led to a sharp recovery in EBITDA margins for the JLR business. This, along with a reduction in gross debt, has significantly improved the financial profile. Adjusted net debt to EBITDA could reduce to less than 1x by fiscal 2024 from around 1.9x in fiscal 2023 and 2.7x in fiscal 2022 as per CRISIL Ratings\u2019 adjusted figures. The ratings may get upgraded if annual JLR revenues continue to grow, supported by volume and realization over the medium term, driving consolidated operating margin of 12-13% and free cash flow generation of Rs 20,000 crore, resulting in adjusted net debt to EBITDA sustaining below 1x."
